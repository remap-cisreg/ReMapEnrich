# ReMapEnrich

Bioinformatics tools to compute statistical enrichment of geonomic regions within ReMap catalogue or any other catalogue of peaks. 

## About

Current next generation sequencing studies generate a large variety of genomic regions ranging from regulatory regions with transcription factors or histone marks ChIP-seq to variant calls or coding/non-coding transcripts. Also, the number of complex catalogues from large-scale integrative efforts are increasing and large sequencing projects. To facilitate the interpretation of functional genomics, epigenomics and genomics data we have developed a R-software package `ReMapEnrich` to identify significantly enriched regions from user defined catalogues. `ReMapEnrich` provide functions to import any in-house catalogue, automate and plot the enrichment analysis for genomic regions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

#### Dependencies

Here are dependencies used in our package. Build will prompt for installation. 

```
R.utils, data.table, RMySQL, GenomicRanges
```

#### Install the ReMapEnrich R-package from GitHub

To install a R package, start by installing the `devtools` package from CRAN. 

```
install.packages("devtools")
```
Install the ReMapEnrich R-package from GitHub using the following code, where you need to remember to list both the author and the name of the package 

```
library(devtools)
install_github("remap-cisreg/ReMapEnrich")
```

#### Installing GitHub packages into RStudio

Although RStudio does have various tools for installing packages, the most straightforward approach is to download the zipped file, open the `ReMapEnrich.Rpoject` file, and in Rstudio Build -> Install and Restart.
Or just follow the steps described in the previous section, entering the code into the Console in RStudio. 


## Using ReMapEnrich

### Basic use

This example is based on small dataset (input and catalog) released with the ReMapEnrich package. It will go through various  steps : loading data,  computing enrichments, visualizing results. 


### Advanced use

### Statistical validation
